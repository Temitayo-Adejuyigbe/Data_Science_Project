# Machine Learning with Titanic Dataset

## This project will walk you through the step by step process of carrying out a machine learning given a dataset. `Titanic Data Here`

THis will involve pertinent sections of a Machine Lerning exercise, such as;

    1. Importing Necesary Libraries
    2. Loading Data
    3. Preliminary/Exploratory Data Analysis
    4. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning (handling Categorical Features)
    5. Feature Engineering (Both Feature Creation and reduction)
    6. Feature Scaling
    7. Modelling
